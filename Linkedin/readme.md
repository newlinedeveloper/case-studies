LinkedIn solved this problem by creating a platform that allowed professionals to build a digital network of contacts and connect with other professionals in their industry.

Members could create a profile, including their work experience and education, and connect with other professionals in their industry. The platform also allowed members to join groups related to their industry, follow companies, and apply for job opportunities. This allowed LinkedIn to become a one-stop-shop for professionals looking to network and find job opportunities.

Additionally, LinkedIn has also become a source of valuable business insights for companies. Businesses can use LinkedIn's data to gain insights into their industry, competitors, and target audience. This has made LinkedIn a valuable tool for businesses looking to stay ahead of the competition and make informed decisions.
